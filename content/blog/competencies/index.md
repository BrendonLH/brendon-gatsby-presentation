### Confidence 
When I take on a task, I know that I have been given the task because I can solve the problem and I know if it is particularly difficult, I am equipped with the tools necessary to complete the task. 

### Initiative
If there is an issue or going to be an issue and someone I know or myself can solve it, then I am going to work on it. Inititative only works if you know what needs to be done.

### Motivation
Seeing the big picture is what motivates me. knowing what the end result can be and how I can make a difference keeps me motivated to see the task followed through.
