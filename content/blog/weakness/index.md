My area of growth is that I don't usually ask for help and when I do need to delegate, I tend to task people out very lightly. Part of teamwork is trusting in the ability of those in your team and that is something I recognize now and continually work on.

 during a task once, I needed to move thousands of boxes of items weighing 20-50lbs over the course of a weekend without a pallet jack or LTL truck. I was tasked with hand unloading tens of pallets containing hundreds of products from one facility to our main facility. I spent 14 hours for 2 days moving boxes by myself. I Completed before the deadline, but I realized that I need to address the fact that I don't like delegating for fear of getting subpar results. I tend to work alone which can result in late deadlines.
