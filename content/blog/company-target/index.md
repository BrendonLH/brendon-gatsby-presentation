“to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy."

If i had to work for any company, it would be Tesla. Between podcasts, News articles, Scientific American and other sources that I scour through, Elon musk's idea of the future is right on track with my own. The advancements they have made by just "Doing" instead of "saying" is the path to the future of tech. From what I read on glassdoor, from people who work there, I know it would be tough but knowing you are making something that actually helps people and the environment seems like a worthwhile struggle. From cars, to rockets and robots, it seems like Tesla makes it all and drives other companies to keep up.

The electric car for example would not be where it is with all other manufacturers if Tesla did not make something so advanced. Tesla Has a vision that coincides with my own and that appeals to me the most. Reaching out and exploring without any limitations.
