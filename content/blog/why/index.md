every day, when I wake up at 4am and get ready to go for a run, i look over and see a housing development of everything that I want and never had. When im outside, fixing my truck because its on its last legs, I watch families with all the things my family never had purchase their first home. My why? my why is so I can have everything I never had growing up, so one day, my kids can learn the things without wondering if they are going to get to eat or sleep in a bed rather than the ground.
