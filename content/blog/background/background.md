 - Motivated
 - Quick Thinking in stressful situations
 - Great at playing the air guitar

## Task Approach 
- Gather data
- determine what finished product would look like
- setup a COA(course of action) step by step
- perform same steps on each step of the process (recursion).
basically, I break everything down into very small pieces. once each piece cant be broken down then I can start working on that piece or move onto the next piece when finished.
